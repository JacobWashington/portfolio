                <h1>Jacob Washington</h1>
                <h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2>

                <p>I am a Full Stack Software Developer, proficient in JavaScript, NodeJS, React, Express, SQL, and
                    MongoDB.
                    I specialize in problem solving and delivering elegant solutions for complex technological needs. My
                    time in the armed forces taught me the importance of teamwork and clear communication, and instilled
                    in
                    me the belief that one should leave all things in better condition than they were found. I’m an open
                    communicator who values transparency and accountability.

                        <h3>Swirv</h3>
                        <p><strong>Swirv</strong> is a story-telling platform created with the reader in mind!
                            Traditionally, an author's greatest responsibility has been to give their
                            readers the full story, to leave no rock unturned. This responsibility, however, curtails
                            the
                            author's ability to give some of their greatest ideas life. Too many brilliant, unfinished
                            stories have never reached readers because an author must commit themselves to the stories
                            they
                            can end. This diservice, to both authors and readers, is out of line with the natural ways
                            in
                            which stories form and develop — dynamically and collaboritively. By allowing every reader
                            the
                            opportunity to contribute to a story, or branch from a storyline at any point to forge a new
                            journey, Swirv realigns the ancient art of storytelling with nature.

                        <p><strong>jargon</strong> is a networking and employment oriented application that connects
                            veterans in tech to colleagues and peers, mentors and employers, training resources, and job
                            opportunities. By creating a networking community of vets in tech, jargon breaks down the
                            barriers of entry many
                            veterans face, and narrows the market for veterans seeking careers and connections within
                            the
                            industry.
